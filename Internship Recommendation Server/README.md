InternshipHub: AI-Powered Internship Recommender (Server)

This is the server-side repository for InternshipHub. You can find the client-side code here: [InternshipHub Client](https://github.com/Pritam7Chakraborty/internship-recommendation-Client).

This is the backend repository for InternshipHub, a robust MERN stack API that powers the AI-driven internship recommendation engine. It's built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and integrates with the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent recommendations.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Secure Authentication: User registration and login with JWT-based authentication.

Rich User Profiles: Stores detailed user data, including education, skills, and interests.

AI Integration: Uses the Gemini API to analyze user profiles and provide personalized internship recommendations with justifications.

Fallback Logic: Automatically switches to a rule-based recommendation system if the AI API is unavailable, ensuring the application remains functional.

Admin Panel Endpoints: Secure CRUD operations for managing the internship database (requires admin login).
